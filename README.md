# Smart-Data-Discovery
This repository involves learning about smart data discovery that is a module in the second year of my IT course.
1. What Is Smart Data Discovery? 🤔
Smart Data Discovery is an AI-driven approach that automates the process of finding meaningful insights hidden within large, diverse datasets. It combines:

Data Preparation: Cleaning and integrating data from various sources.
Data Visualization: Transforming data into charts, graphs, and dashboards.
Advanced Analytics: Using machine learning and AI to detect patterns, trends, and anomalies.
It takes traditional data discovery to the next level by speeding up analysis and reducing human error.
