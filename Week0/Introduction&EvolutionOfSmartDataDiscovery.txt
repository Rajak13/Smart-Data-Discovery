I am referencing the data world article on Smart Data Discovery to learn about the basics of Smart Data Discovery.

To put in simple words, Smart Data Discovery is an approach used by data analysts to figure out important
insights from complex datasets. It is smart as it removes the reliablilty on manual processes that were used
traditionally and automates much of the process. It usex Machine Learning and AI to analyze patterns/trends and find
relationships amongst the data that may have gone unnoticed if done manually.

#Evolution of Data Discovery

First versions of Data Discovery required much technical expersite and a large amount of time to extract insights
manually. This led to delays in analysis and the chances of human making errors were also much higher.

Due to the exponential increase of data, such traditional methods became impractical. They can't meet 
the demands of modern businesses and to address this challenge, Gartner came up with an AI-driven approach.

Smart Data Discovery has enabled us to analyze large volumes of data, powered by machine learning. An example would
be Ltft- they developed Amunsden- a data discovery and metadata engine. This tool provides a centralized search interface through which data scientists can quickly find datasets and their owners.

#Benefits of smart data discovery
- Efficiency: Smart Data Discovery enables for automation of repetitive tasks like data preparation and visualization that allows you to focus on more important tasks.
-Accessibility: Even non-technical users can access and understand data. The creation of highly data-driven organization that is 3x more likely to make better decisions.
-Scalibility: Intregrates data from multiple sources and adapts quickly to growing demands.
-Actionable insights: Highlights important patterns and anomalies within data to help you act on opportunities and challenges. For example, Netflix uses smart data discovery to identify viewing trends and provide real-time recommendations based on viewers interests.

#Challenges of smart data discovery
- Data quality: Smart data discovery relies on the quality of the data. If the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent, the insights generated may be unreliable. This is why data cleaning and preparation is a crucial step.
- Integration: Integrating data from multiple sources can be challenging. Different data sources may have different formats, structures, and semantics, making it difficult to combine them into a single, coherent dataset.
- Security: Smart data discovery involves accessing and analyzing sensitive data, which raises concerns about data privacy and security. It's important to ensure that data is protected and that access is controlled and monitored.
- Cost: Implementing smart data discovery can be expensive, requiring investment in technology, infrastructure, and expertise. It's important to weigh the benefits against the costs and ensure that the investment is justified.
- Complexity: Smart data discovery can be complex, requiring a deep understanding of data, analytics, and technology. This can be a barrier for organizations that lack the necessary expertise.

# Why is this necessary?

- To make data-driven decisions, you need to be able to find and access the data you need quickly and easily. Smart data discovery helps you do that by making data more accessible and searchable.
- It helps you to understand the context and meaning of data, which is crucial for making informed decisions.
- It helps you to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in data, which can help you to spot opportunities and risks.
- It helps you to integrate data from multiple sources, which can provide a more complete picture of the situation.
- It helps you to ensure that data is accurate, complete, and up-to-date, which is crucial for making reliable decisions.
- It helps you to automate and streamline data discovery and analysis processes, which can save time and effort.
