# Introduction

For smart data and discovery, we will be utilizing Python.We shall be working with some common libaraies
like:
-numpy: this libary helps with mathematical operations.
-matplotlib: this libary helps with visualization of data through figures.
-pandas: this libary helps with data manipulation and analysis.

# Data Science
- It refres to the methods and techniques for extracting useful information from a set of data.
- It is a field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from structured and unstructured data.
- It  helps businesses gain competitive advantage, increase performance and satisfy customers.

# Data analytics lifecycle
i. Business understanding: Refers to understanding the business problem.
ii. Data understanding: Refers to understanding the data and the problem.
iii. Data preparation: Refers to cleaning and transforming the data.
iv. Modelling: Refers to building the model for predicting the outcome.
v. Evaluation: Refers to evaluating the model for accuracy and performance.
vi. Deployment: Refers to deploying the model in production form.

#Common Data Mining Tasks
i. Classification: Refers to predicting a discrete label.
ii. Regression: Refers to predicting a continuous value.
iii. Clustering: Refers to grouping similar data points together.
iv. Association: Refers to finding rules that describe large portions of your data.
v. Anomaly Detection: Refers to finding outliers in your data.
vi. Sequence Mining: Refers to finding patterns in sequences of data.
vii. Dimensionality Reduction: Refers to reducing the number of input variables.
viii. Recommendation: Refers to recommending items to users.
ix. Text Mining: Refers to extracting information from text.
x. Web Mining: Refers to extracting information from web data.

#Common Data Mining Algorithms
i. Linear Regression : Refers to predicting a continuous value.
ii. Logistic Regression : Refers to predicting a discrete label.
iii. Decision Trees : Refers to predicting a  value
iv. Random Forests : Refers to predicting a satisfying label.
v. Support Vector Machines : Refers to predicting a continuous value.
